;This file is not normally needed for the majority of apps.  We recommend including it for any apps that must have user settings moved to App when running and back to Data when closed.  That way, if Windows crashes/restarts or an unsafe eject is done and the user then upgrades the app without running it first so that the PA.c Launcher can clean up the data, no data is lost
